# PLAN A: Enhanced Tool Building Marketplace with Real Communication

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Changes

### 1. **Tool Building Focus**
- **Clarify**: Tools are Python functions that can call existing tools
- **Prompt**: "You're writing Python functions. Use `context.call_tool()` to use existing tools"
- **Energy Model**: ONLY get energy when YOUR tools are used by others, NOT for using tools

### 2. **Real Agent Communication**
- **Discussion Rounds**: Before acting, agents have discussion rounds
- **Convince & Negotiate**: Agents pitch tool ideas and try to convince others
- **Response System**: Agents can respond to each other's messages before taking action

### 3. **Communication Flow**
```
Round Structure:
1. DISCUSSION PHASE (2-3 exchanges)
   - Agent_01: "I propose building X tool because..."
   - Agent_02: "That's interesting, but what about Y instead?"
   - Agent_01: "Good point, let me refine the idea..."

2. ACTION PHASE  
   - Agents take actions based on discussion
   - Propose/Support/Build tools
   - Use existing tools to build new ones

3. REWARD PHASE
   - Energy only for tool usage utility
   - Communication network effects
```

### 4. **Enhanced Tool System**
- **Function Templates**: Provide clear Python function templates
- **Tool Composition**: Tools can call other tools via `context.call_tool()`
- **Dependency Tracking**: Track which tools depend on which
- **Real Integration**: Built tools immediately available to all agents

### 5. **Better Energy Model**
```python
Energy Sources:
- Proposing popular tools: +5 (one-time)
- Supporting good proposals: +3 (encourages validation) 
- Building tools: +10 (implementation work)
- Tool Utility: +X when others use YOUR tools (ongoing)
- Communication: Small bonus for productive discussions

NO energy for:
- Using existing tools
- Using others' tools
```

## ðŸ›  Implementation Steps

1. **Fix Success Rate**: Update action counting for tool building
2. **Enhance Prompts**: Clarify tool = Python function
3. **Add Discussion Rounds**: Multi-turn conversation before action
4. **Fix Energy Model**: Remove energy for tool usage
5. **Improve Tool Templates**: Better generated code

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome
- Real collaborative discussions about tool design
- Agents convince each other about tool value
- Higher quality tools through peer review
- Sustainable energy economy based on utility
