Processing Steps:\n   - Parse the condition string into an evaluable expression.\n   - Iterate over each data item.\n   - Evaluate the condition in the context of each data item.\n   - Collect and return data items where the condition evaluates to True.\n\n3. Safety and Security:\n   - Use a safe evaluation method (e.g., ast.literal_eval or a custom parser) to prevent code injection.\n   - Support common comparison operators and logical operators.\n   \n4.

This tool adapts to various data types and sorting needs, enabling dynamic and efficient data organization.\n\n**Tool Type:**  \nUtility / Data Processing\n\n**Implementation Outline:**  \n1. **Input Parameters:**  \n   - Dataset (list or array of data objects)  \n   - Sorting algorithms (string identifier: 'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort')  \n   - Comparison functions (optional; default to standard comparison)  \n   - Sorting criteria (list of tuples: (attribute/key, order), supporting multi-level sorting)  \n\n2. **Functionality:**  \n   - Validate inputs and select the specified sorting algorithm.  \n   - If custom comparison functions are provided, incorporate them into the sorting process.  \n   - Support multi-level sorting by applying criteria in order, using stable sorts or custom comparator chaining.  \n   - Return the sorted dataset.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps:**  \n   - Define individual sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) with hooks for custom comparison functions.  \n   - Implement a comparator generator that can handle multi-criteria sorting.  \n   - Create a main function that orchestrates the selection of algorithm, applies the comparator, and sorts the data accordingly.  \n   - Ensure the function is efficient and handles large datasets gracefully.\n\n4. **Optional Enhancements:**  \n   - Add profiling to select the most efficient algorithm based on dataset size.  \n   - Enable partial or incremental sorting.  \n   - Provide a user-friendly API or CLI for easy integration.\n\nThis adaptive_sorter will fill current gaps by offering a customizable, multi-algorithm, multi-criteria sorting tool suitable for complex data ecosystems.",

Gaps in the Current Ecosystem:\n- Limited Sorting and Ordering Capabilities: Although we have 'multi_sorter' and 'advanced_sorter', the ecosystem lacks specialized, flexible, and efficient sorting tools, especially for complex or large datasets.\n- Absence of Customizable Sorting Algorithms: No tools tailored for different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) that could allow users to select based on their needs.\n- Lack of Hierarchical and Multi-level Sorting Tools: Tools that can handle multi-criteria or hierarchical sorting to enable complex data ordering.\n- No tools dedicated to ordering datasets based on custom or user-defined criteria.\n\n2. Most Valuable Next Build:\n- Building a versatile, modular sorting tool that supports multiple algorithms, customizable comparison functions, and multi-level sorting would significantly enhance the ecosystem.\n- Alternatively, a tool that can generate sorted views or orderings based on various criteria dynamically could be highly useful.\n\n3. Specific Tool to Create:\n- I should develop an **'adaptive_sorter'** tool that allows users to specify sorting algorithms, comparison functions, and multi-level sorting criteria dynamically. This tool would combine flexibility with performance, filling current gaps and expanding functionality.\n\n**Next step:**\nDesign and implement the 'adaptive_sorter' tool to support multiple sorting strategies, customizable ordering, and complex sorting hierarchies."

Gaps in the Ecosystem:\n   - Limited variety of utility functions for common data operations such as sorting, filtering, aggregating, and transforming.\n   - Notably, neighbor agents have specialized tools like 'data_filter', 'data_transformer', and various sorters, indicating a need for robust, flexible utilities in these areas.\n   - Existing tools focus on data normalization, inspection, and cleaning but lack comprehensive utility functions that can be reused across multiple workflows.\n   - Absence of tools for data validation, error handling, or summarization, which are vital for robust data processing pipelines.\n   \n2. Most Valuable Next Build:\n   - Developing versatile, reusable utility functions for data manipulation would greatly enhance flexibility and efficiency.\n   - Since neighbor agents have sorting tools, creating advanced filtering or aggregation utilities could fill a significant gap.\n   - A tool that combines multiple utility functions\u2014like a \"Data Utility Suite\"\u2014could streamline common tasks and promote code reuse.\n   \n3. Specific Tool to Create:\n   - I suggest building a **\"Data Transformation Helper\"** tool that offers a suite of core utility functions such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and transforming data.\n   - This tool could include functions like:\n     - `filter_data`\n     - `sort_data`\n     - `aggregate_data`\n     - `transform_data`\n   - Making these functions modular and customizable would maximize their utility across different workflows.\n\n**Next step:** Develop the \"Data Transformation Helper\" tool with a focus on core utility functions that can be easily integrated and reused."
