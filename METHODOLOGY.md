# Methodology

## Experimental Design: Evolutionary Multi-Agent Tool Creation with Boids Rules

### Overview

This study implements a novel hybrid approach combining **boids flocking behavior** with **evolutionary algorithms** to investigate emergent intelligence in multi-agent tool-building ecosystems. The methodology integrates three key components: (1) local neighborhood interactions based on Reynolds' boids rules, (2) Darwinian selection pressure based on tool complexity, and (3) prompt-level evolution for agent specialization adaptation.

### Agent Architecture

#### Core Agent Loop
Each agent follows a standardized cognitive cycle:
```
observe → reflect → build_tools → build_tests → promote_tools
```

**Observation Phase**: Agents observe their local neighborhood (k=2 nearest neighbors in ring topology) or global ecosystem, depending on experimental condition.

**Reflection Phase**: Agents generate strategic reflections using Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, incorporating either boids constraints or global ecosystem analysis.

**Tool Creation Phase**: Agents design and implement Python tools based on their reflections, with automatic complexity analysis using Tool Complexity Index (TCI).

**Testing Phase**: Comprehensive test suites are automatically generated and executed for each tool, with passing tools promoted to the shared library.

### Boids Rules Implementation

The system implements three classical boids rules adapted for tool-building contexts:

#### 1. Separation (Diversity Constraint)
- **Metric**: Jaccard distance between tool feature sets
- **Threshold**: ≥ 0.45 distance from all neighbors
- **Purpose**: Ensures tool diversity and prevents redundant development

#### 2. Alignment (Style Consistency)
- **Components**: I/O style, naming conventions, error handling policies
- **Requirement**: Match ≥ 2 of 3 majority neighbor styles
- **Purpose**: Promotes ecosystem coherence and interoperability

#### 3. Cohesion (Task Relevance)
- **Metric**: Coverage of task intent tags
- **Threshold**: ≥ 60% coverage of required task tags
- **Purpose**: Maintains focus on experimental objectives

### Evolutionary Algorithm Integration

#### Selection Mechanism
- **Strategy**: Fitness-proportionate selection based on tool complexity
- **Selection Rate**: Bottom 20% elimination per generation
- **Fitness Function**: Average TCI (Tool Complexity Index) score across agent's tools
- **Minimum Population**: Maintains ≥ 3 agents for stability

#### Reproduction Operators

**Crossover (50% probability)**:
```
System Prompt: "Create a new agent specialization that combines 
the best aspects of both successful parents."

Input: Parent₁.specific_prompt + Parent₂.specific_prompt + performance_data
Output: Hybrid agent specialization
```

**Mutation (50% probability)**:
```
System Prompt: "Create a mutation of this specialization - keep it 
related but explore a different angle or approach."

Input: Parent.specific_prompt + performance_data  
Output: Varied agent specialization
```

#### Evolution Timing
- **Frequency**: Every 5 rounds (configurable)
- **Trigger Condition**: `round_num % evolution_frequency == 0`
- **Population Update**: Immediate replacement with evolved agents

### Experimental Conditions

#### Control Variables
- **Population Size**: 5 agents
- **Experiment Duration**: 5 rounds
- **Neighborhood Size**: k=2 (boids condition)
- **Evolution Frequency**: Round 3 trigger
- **Selection Pressure**: 20% elimination rate

#### Treatment Conditions
1. **Boids + Evolution**: Local observation + boids constraints + evolutionary pressure
2. **Boids Only**: Local observation + boids constraints + no evolution
3. **Evolution Only**: Global observation + no boids constraints + evolutionary pressure  
4. **Control**: Global observation + no constraints + no evolution

### Measurement Framework

#### Tool Complexity Index (TCI)
```
TCI = α×Code_Complexity + β×Interface_Complexity + γ×Compositional_Complexity
```
Where:
- α = 0.5 (code structure weight)
- β = 1.0 (interface design weight)  
- γ = 10.0 (tool composition weight - heavily prioritized)

#### Performance Metrics
- **Tool Creation Rate**: Tools per agent per round
- **Test Success Rate**: Percentage of tools passing automated tests
- **Promotion Rate**: Tools advanced to shared library
- **Complexity Evolution**: TCI score progression over time
- **Diversity Index**: Jaccard distance distribution across tool ecosystem

#### Emergent Behavior Indicators
- **Collaboration Events**: Cross-agent tool usage frequency
- **Specialization Divergence**: Agent prompt evolution trajectories
- **Ecosystem Coherence**: Style alignment convergence patterns
- **Innovation Rate**: Novel tool category emergence

### Data Collection Protocol

#### Real-Time Tracking
- Agent actions and decisions logged with timestamps
- Tool creation and testing results recorded
- Boids constraint satisfaction measured per interaction
- Evolution events captured with parent-offspring relationships

#### Post-Experiment Analysis
- Tool complexity distributions analyzed
- Agent specialization evolution trajectories mapped
- Ecosystem-level emergence patterns identified
- Cross-condition comparative analysis performed

### Experimental Validity Considerations

#### Internal Validity
- **Randomization**: Agent initialization order randomized
- **Isolation**: Each experiment run in separate environment
- **Replication**: Multiple runs with identical parameters

#### External Validity
- **Generalizability**: Multiple task domains tested
- **Scalability**: Population sizes from 3-10 agents tested
- **Robustness**: Various neighborhood topologies evaluated

#### Construct Validity
- **TCI Validation**: Complexity metrics validated against human expert ratings
- **Boids Fidelity**: Rule implementations verified against Reynolds' specifications
- **Evolution Effectiveness**: Selection pressure validated through fitness improvements

### Limitations and Assumptions

#### Technical Limitations
- **API Rate Limiting**: Azure OpenAI quotas may introduce temporal artifacts
- **Deterministic LLM**: Temperature settings balance creativity vs. reproducibility
- **Computational Constraints**: Tool execution limited to Python environment

#### Theoretical Assumptions
- **Rational Agents**: Agents follow designed behavioral protocols
- **Complexity Correlation**: TCI scores correlate with tool utility
- **Prompt Plasticity**: LLM-generated specializations effectively guide behavior

This methodology enables systematic investigation of how local interaction rules (boids) and global selection pressure (evolution) interact to produce emergent collective intelligence in artificial agent societies.
